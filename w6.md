# Week 6. Finding Frequent Itemset

## Motivation
- Association rule discovery
    - Find associations between items in a dataset
    - Given a set of transactions, find rules that will predict the occurrence of an item based on the occurrence of other items in the transaction

## Market-Basket Model
- Large set of items
- Large set of baskets, each basket is a small subset of
items
- Want to discover association rules

## Frequent Itemset
- Itemset – collection of one or more items
- k-itemset: itemset that contains k items
- **Support** for itemset I: number of baskets containing all items in I
- Frequent itemset: an itemset whose support is ≥ minimum support threshold (minsup)

## Association Rule
- IF-THEN rules about the contents of baskets
    - { i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub>} → j means: “if a basket contains all of i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub> then it is likely to contain j
- Rule evaluation metrics:
    - Support of a rule is the fraction of baskets that contain the itemset {i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub>, j}
    - Confidence of this association rule is the probability of j given I = {i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>,…,i<sub>k</sub>}
## Find Association Rule
- Find all association rules with support ≥ minsup and confidence ≥ minconf
- Brute-force approach
    - List all possible association rules
    - Compute support and confidence for each rule
    - Prune rules that fail the minsup and minconf thresholds
    - Computationally prohibitive
## Mining Association Rule
1.  Find all frequent itemsets I whose support ≥ minsupp
2.  Generate rules
    - For every subset X of I, generate X → I − X
    - Output rules above confidence threshold
    - If | I | = k, we have 2k – 2 candidate association rules that involve all the attributes (ignoring I → ∅ and ∅ → I) 
## Rule Generation
- Confidence of rules generated from the same itemset has **anti-monotone property**: If X’ ⊆ X -> f(X’) ≥ f(X)
   - If I = {A,B,C,D}, then conf (ABC → D) ≥ conf (AB → CD) ≥ conf (A → BCD)
    - Recall: conf (X → Y) = support ( X ∪ Y) / support (X)

## Find Frequent Itemsets
- Naïve method: Read baskets once, count in main memory the occurrences of each pair
    - From each basket of n items, generate its n(n-1)/2 pairs by two nested loops. 
- Counting Pairs in Memory
    - Represent items by integers 1 to n
    - Count pairs of items {i, j} only if i < j
    - Use a 2-dimensional array M where entry M[i, j] gives the count of item pair {i, j} with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.
        - half of the metrix is wasted
    - Use Triangular Matrix or Triples Method
        - Use a 1-dimensional triangular array T
        - Keep pair counts in lexicographical order:
            - {1,2}, {1, 3}, …{1, n}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, …{2, n}, {3, 4}…{n-2, n-1}, {n-2, n}, {n-1, n}
        - Store count of pair {i, j} at entry T[k] with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n where k = (i − 1)(n - i/2) + j - i
