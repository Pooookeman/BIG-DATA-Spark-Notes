# Week 7. Recommender System

The Long Tail

- A phenomenon whereby firms can make money by offering a near-limitless session.
- demand exists, even though products are not popular enough for traditional retailers to carry them.

Formal Model
- C = set of customers
- S = set of items
- U = C x S -> R, utility function(customers' preferences for certain items)
    - R = set of ratings
    - R is a totally ordered set
- utility matrix
    - sparse
    - goal of a recommender is to predict the blanks
- Challenges 
    - How to gather “known” ratings for matrix
    - How to extrapolate unknown ratings from known ones
    - How to evaluate extrapolation methods

## Gather Rating
- Explicit
    - ask people: does not work well because people do not like to be bothered.
- Implicit
    - learn from user actions
        - purchase behaviour, clicks, time spent on the demo, etc.
        - May not be certain.
    - How about low ratings?

## Extrapolate ratings
- utility matrix is sparse.
    - cold start: 
        - new users/items
    - most people did not rate items

## Content-Based Recommender System
- Focus on Properties of Items
- recommend to customer (C) items that are similar to previous items rated highly by C
- Item profiles
    - profile is a set of features


## Collaborative Filtering
