# Week 5. Finding Similar iterms

## Distance Measure
**Jaccard similarity** of two sets is the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union:
>sim (C1, C2) = |C1 ∩ C2| / |C1 ∪ C2|

**Jaccard distance**:
>d (C1, C2) = 1 - |C1 ∩ C2| / |C1 ∪ C2|

## Steps
1. shingling - converst documents to sets
2. Min-Hashing - convert large sets to short signature, while preserving similarity
3. Locality-Sensitive Hashing - Focus on pairs of signatures likely to be from similar documents

## 1.Shingling
- consider a sequence of k words
    - account for ordering of words
    - more effective in terms of accuracy
- A k-shingle (or k-gram) for a document is a sequence of k tokens that appears in the document
    - Tokens can be characters, words or some feature/object, depending on the application
- Caveat(warn): You must pick k large enough, or most documents will have most shingles
- compress shingles
    - use a hash function to map strings
    - treat resulted bucket number as the shingle
    - represent a document by the set of hash values of its k-shingles
- Motivation for Minhash/LSH
    - Find a way to hash a document to a single (small size) value, and similar documents to the same value
## Minhash
- Seminal algorithm for near-duplicate detection of webpages
- Hash the set of document shingles (big in terms of space requirement) into a signature (relatively small size)
- **Similarities of signatures and similarities of shingles MUST BE related**
    - Need one that satisfies the following:
        - if sim(D1,D2) is high, then with high prob. h(D1) = h(D2)
        - if sim(D1,D2) is low, then with high prob. h(D1) ≠ h(D2)
- encode sets as bit vectors
- From Sets to Boolean Matrices
    - when compute for the similarity M<sub>00</sub> should not be considered
- (More to include)
