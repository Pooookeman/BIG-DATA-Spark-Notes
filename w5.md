# Week 5. Finding Similar iterms

## Distance Measure
**Jaccard similarity** of two sets is the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union:
>sim (C1, C2) = |C1 ∩ C2| / |C1 ∪ C2|

**Jaccard distance**:
>d (C1, C2) = 1 - |C1 ∩ C2| / |C1 ∪ C2|

## Steps
1. shingling - convert documents to sets
2. Min-Hashing - convert large sets to short signature, while preserving similarity
3. Locality-Sensitive Hashing - Focus on pairs of signatures likely to be from similar documents

## 1.Shingling
- consider a sequence of k words
    - account for ordering of words
    - more effective in terms of accuracy
- A k-shingle (or k-gram) for a document is a sequence of k tokens that appears in the document
    - Tokens can be characters, words or some feature/object, depending on the application
- Caveat(warn): You must pick k large enough, or most documents will have most shingles
- compress shingles
    - use a hash function to map strings
    - treat resulted bucket number as the shingle
    - represent a document by the set of hash values of its k-shingles
## Minhash
- Motivation:
    - Find a way to hash a document to a single (small size) value, and similar documents to the same value
- Signatures: short integer vectors that represent the sets, and reflect their similarity
- convert large sets to short signatures while preserving similarity
- Seminal algorithm for near-duplicate detection of webpages
- Hash the set of document shingles (big in terms of space requirement) into a signature (relatively small size)
- **Similarities of signatures and similarities of shingles MUST BE related**
    - Need one that satisfies the following:
        - if sim(D1,D2) is high, then with high prob. h(D1) = h(D2)
        - if sim(D1,D2) is low, then with high prob. h(D1) ≠ h(D2)
- encode sets as bit vectors
- From Sets to Boolean Matrices
    - when compute for the similarity M<sub>00</sub> should not be considered
- Permutations are expensive. Simulate the effect of a random permutation through random hash function

## Locality Sensitive Hashing
- Focus on pairs of signatures likely to be from similar documents
1.  Given N documents, derive k minhash signatures for each document
2. Hash columns of signature matric to buckets
3. Documents that fall into the same buckets are likely to be similar – candidate pair
4. Finding all pairs within a bucket is computationally cheaper

- More false postive
    - Because of collision (subject to hash function
and number of buckets), need a refinement step
- Many false negative likely
    - Because only one hash function on the entire column of signature
- Apply hash function on the column multiple times, each on a partition of the column
    - similar columns will be hashed to the same bucket
    - Candidate pairs are those that hash at least once to the same bucket
## Combining the Techniques
1. shingling: convert documents to sets
2. Min-Hashing: convert large sets to short signatures
3. Locality-Sensitive Hashing:
Focus on pairs of signatures likely to be from similar documents.
